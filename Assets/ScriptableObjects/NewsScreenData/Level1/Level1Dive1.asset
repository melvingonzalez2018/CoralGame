  bossText: "Your goal for the next three dives is to reach 100% Coral Density by
    hammering juvenile corals into every limestone rock with available space. There\u2019s
    only 2 minutes and 30 seconds per dive so you have to move fast.\r\n\r\nRemember
    to:\r\n\u2022 Harvest coral fragments from adult corals\r\n\u2022 Place coral
    fragments in nurseries so they can grow between dives\r\n\u2022 Hammer juvenile
    coral into limestone rocks to grow into adult corals\r\n\r\nNow let\u2019s dive
    into it! \r"
